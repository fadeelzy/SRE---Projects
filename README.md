## SRE Projects – Infrastructure Reliability, Observability & Automation

This project showcases real-world Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices by designing and operating production-grade systems with automated deployments, full observability, fault tolerance, and measurable performance improvements. It demonstrates how I apply reliability principles to achieve 99.9% uptime, reduce deployment risks, and build systems that are secure, scalable, and self-healing.

⭐ Key Achievements

Built fully automated cloud infrastructure using Terraform/Kubernetes, enabling repeatable, zero-downtime environment provisioning.

Implemented end-to-end observability with Prometheus, Grafana & Alertmanager — delivering real-time metrics, actionable alerts, and reduction of mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) by ~60%.

Designed a centralized logging pipeline to streamline debugging and reduce incident resolution time (MTTR under 10 minutes).

Created CI/CD pipelines (GitHub/GitLab) with automated testing, security scans, and rolling deployments, cutting deployment time by ~50%
